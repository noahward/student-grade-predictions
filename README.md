# Student Grade Predictions
- Dataset included a variety of student attributes including student grades which were uzed to train and test several models
- Dataset attributes were explored, manipulated, cleaned and visualized during the Exploratory Data Analysis
- Goal was to train our models based upon these attributes, and find a model that best predicts a students average grade of math, reading and writing
- These five models were chosen and tested due to a combonation of their speed and accuracy for predicting numeric values:
    1. Linear Regression
    2. GradientBoostingRegressor
    2. RandomForestRegressor
    3. DecisionTreeRegressor
    4. KNeighborsRegressor

- Linear regression ended up being the best fitting model (although still a poor fit)
- This was unsuprising due to the linearity of the data
